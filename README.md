# ATtiny13A-MOSFET

## Overview

I had been searching on how to run an esp8266 data logger with minimumal power consumption on a 18650 3.7V Li-ion battery and come accross this solution.<sup>[1](#solution)</sup>

Althought you can minimise the power consuption of an esp8266 with deep sleep, usually you have other sensors/chips that are cosuming power. The idea is to use an Atmel ATtiny13A - *Microchip picoPower 8-bit AVR RISC-based microcontroller*, it's up and running 24/7 while everything else is without power, so the consumption of the rest of the circuit is 0A. ATtyni13A consumption is only 0.005mA (5ÂµA) in a sleep mode.

As you can see, ATtyni13A is used only as a controller of 1 N-channel MOSFET, that is turning on/off a 3.3V power regulator for the esp8266 and it's sensors.</br></br>
